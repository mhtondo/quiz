      <p>Hello! My name is Michelle H. Tondo, currently studying at Asian College, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Philippines. I'm taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I live in Cadawinonan, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. I had a lot of life goals that I wanted to accomplish in order to show everyone that, with the support of my friends and family, I was capable of achieving anything. One of my current goals is to complete my education so that I may find a good career and help my younger brother complete his studies. I want to express my gratitude for visiting my website.</p>

       <div class="topic">Entertainment</div>
       <p>I've been really into Korean dramas since 2016 since they gave me a lot of realizations in my life. That's why, up until now, I've still watched different Korean dramas during my free time. I also love all the plot twists that they have compared to different dramas that I've watched so far.</p>

    <div class="topic">Travelling</div>
    <p>One of my all-time favourite hobbies is traveling. My mother has always taken us to her hometown, and it was at that age that I first discovered how much fun it is to travel and discover new places. It is good to eventually meet new friends through that kind of trip. I really hope I can find my traveling companion soon.</p>

    <div class="topic">Music</div>
    <p>I truly enjoy listening to music, especially when I'm by myself, because it enables me to feel the different emotions I encounter in everyday life. When I'm upset over something or myself, I feel like the music is the only thing that can make me feel better.</p>
